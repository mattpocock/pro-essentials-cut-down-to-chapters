## Quickstart

### Install PNPM

Because this course is _so big_ we're using `pnpm` as the package manager. It's like `npm`, but results in fewer `node_modules` saved to disk.

[Install `pnpm` globally](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Install Dependencies

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
pnpm install

# Asks you which exercise you'd like to run, and runs it
pnpm run exercise
```

## How to take the course

You'll notice that the course is split into exercises. Each exercise is split into a `*.problem` and a `*.solution`.

To take an exercise:

1. Run `pnpm exercise`
2. Choose which exercise you'd like to run.

This course encourages **active, exploratory learning**. In the video, I'll explain a problem, and **you'll be asked to try to find a solution**. To attempt a solution, you'll need to:

1. Check out [TypeScript's docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).
1. Try to find something that looks relevant.
1. Give it a go to see if it solves the problem.

You'll know if you've succeeded because the tests will pass.

**If you succeed**, or **if you get stuck**, unpause the video and check out the `*.solution`. You can see if your solution is better or worse than mine!
